 * Event fired when a plot-related notification is about to be dispatched.

 * <p>If additional checks are required before a notification is dispatched,
 * listeners can intercept this event and inspect the {@link NotificationType}.
 * Calling {@link #setCancelled()} will prevent the notification from being sent.
 * However, preferably this should be controlled through the pluginâ€™s config.</p>

 * <p>Note: {@link NotificationType#ON_INACTIVITY} is not managed by the API and
 * will never be dispatched automatically.
 * Refer to {@link InactivityNoticeEvent} to call this event manually.</p>
